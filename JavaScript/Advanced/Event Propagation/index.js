// // 1️⃣: Event Propagation (Event Bubbling and Event Capturing)
/*Event bubbling and event capturing are the two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM API, when an event occurs in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle for that event.
The event propagation mode determines in which order the elements receive the event
-Top-bottom...event capturing
-bottom-top..event bubbling*/ 

//addEventListener( ,  , true/false) false by default-> event bubbling true-> event capturing
