// HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.
// When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.


// 👨‍🏫 HTML Events
// An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

// Here are some examples of HTML events:

// An HTML web page has finished loading
// An HTML input field was changed
// An HTML button was clicked
// Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

// JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

// HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, 
// to be added to HTML elements.



// section 1️⃣ 4 ways of writing Events in JavaScript

// 1: using inline events alert();
// 2: By Calling a funcion (We already seen and most common way of writing) 
// 3: using Inline events (HTML onclick="" property and element.onclick)
// 4: using Event Listeners (addEventListener and IE's attachEvent)
